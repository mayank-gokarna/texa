[[intro]]
== Background
As part of the Guided Development of microservices on OpenShift,
there is an activity to sample develop the use case identified in the Design thinking workshop.

This document/page defines the steps involved in this development activity for the offer execution team.
This guide assumes you plan to develop your microservices in Java using Spring Boot framework  or Node.js/Angular.js
however, most of the steps remain same even if you are using a different technology e.g. Python
and you only need to follow the technology specific build, test and run toolset.
